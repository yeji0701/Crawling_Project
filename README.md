Crawling Project
=================
This project started off from a question: "Past fashion trend came back as 'newtro (new + retro)', so can music trend come back too?"
The primary purpose was to crawl music data in the years 1960s~20100s from a music chart to explore and visualize. During this process, came an idea for a music recommendation system to answer another question: "What kind of modern music will a person with a playlist from the past listen to?"

The major activities in this project:
* Crawling data from 'Melon' chart
* Cleansing and exploring the gathered data
* Building algorithm for music recommendation
* Coding Flask and HTML to put algorithm in action

Built with:
* Jupyter Notebook
* VS Code
* Python3
